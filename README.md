### Okay, so here's the deal.

This repository is for tracking bugs and providing suggestions for ALL CoFH mods. It's far easier for us to check one place instead of 6 or 7. Use the issue tracker associated with this repository for bug reports and feature suggestions.

### If your game is crashing on startup:

- The issue is practically guaranteed to be on your end. This is not tech support, please check the IRC. The link is below.
- Check for duplicate issues with the 'READ ME' label. Quick link [here](https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22READ+ME%22)
- Update to Java 8. Uninstall Java 6.
- Update your mods! Use mods ONLY from http://teamcofh.com/downloads or https://www.curseforge.com/members/TeamCoFH/projects.
- Be sure you do not have duplicates of mods.
- Make sure you've done the above.
- Seriously, if you are crashing on startup, it is almost certainly something you have done incorrectly.
- Try to make the crash happen with just CoFH mods - nothing else.
- If that last step worked, you may have a mod-conflict. Update all of your mods.
- If you still have an actual issue, report away!

### If you want to report a bug:

- Include the mod name and version.
- Include a pastebin (or equivalent) link to a list of all your mods.
- Include the crash log
- Be descriptive.
- Be respectful.
- Use proper grammar and spelling.

If you can't do the above, please do not report any bugs.

### If you have a suggestion:

- Include the mod name.
- Provide a reason.
- Be descriptive.
- Be respectful.
- Use proper grammar and spelling.

If you cannot do the above, please do not suggest any features.
